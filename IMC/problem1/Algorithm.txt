Terminology:
1. Score(NODE) : 2*numFreeCpu + sum over all i (numFreeCpu/EdgeLength(NODE,i))
2. Score(EDGE) : numFreeCpu(edge.to) / EdgeLength(edge.from, edge.to);

Algorithm:
1. Select a master node - the node with the maximum node score;
2. Maintain a priority queue of edges with priority being Edge Score.
3. Insert all edges connected to masterNode to the priority queue, and then iterate until either we have got n cpus or the queue is empty
