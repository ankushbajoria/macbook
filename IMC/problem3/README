ASSUMPTIONS:
1. All stations are equidistant, implying each train takes constant time between station.
2. A partially loaded train is not filled even if it has remaining capacity.
3. Correctness is more important than performance.
4. Time to load is 2s per packet, time to unload is 1.5s per packet.
5. 4 trains each run with a latency of 4,3,2,1, and capacity of 10,8,12,5 respectively, and they start from 0,1,2,3 station numbers respectively 
6. The behavior of random people dropping packets is emulated by choosing with 1/3rd probability, when the train is empty, to load random number of packets, to be dropped at random station

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDING NEW STATIONS and TRAINS:
- increase NUM_STATIONS from 8 to required value
- add Train class object and copy the lines for one of the threads for the new thread
